# Top-of-Funnel Performance Review — MMM Reallocation Case

This project is a practical case study completed for a **Professional Service Analyst** prompt, using **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** to help validate the efficiency of **top-of-funnel (TOF)** marketing spend for a **baby mattress brand**.

---

## 📌 Background

**Brand:** [Brand Name]  
**Annual Marketing Spend:** ~$5M USD  
**Main Sponsor:** Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)  
**Business Problem:**  
The CMO wants to validate whether current TOF spending is truly driving incremental value. Their existing **Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)** tracking has gaps — especially for awareness and prospecting channels — making it hard to trust standard reported ROIs.

To solve this, the brand turned to **MMM** as an independent lens to test performance, identify underperforming channels, and estimate the upside potential if budget is reallocated more efficiently.

---

## 📌 Case Study Goal

✅ Evaluate all active TOF channels using MMM output.  
✅ Classify channels as **GOOD**, **WATCHLIST**, or **WEAK** based on ROI, uncertainty, spend scale, and predicted revenue contribution.  
✅ Identify inefficient spend segments (ROI < 2).  
✅ Quantify the realistic incremental revenue if that budget is shifted to stronger channels.  
✅ Communicate a clear, conservative upside range and practical next steps.

## 📌 Key Finding

- Identified **\$263K+** in spend across **underperforming TOF channels** (ROI < 2).
- Theoretical maximum incremental revenue if reallocated to higher-performing channels (ROI ~9) ≈ **\$2.2M**.
- After applying **marginal diminishing returns** and a **conservative 15–20% realization factor**, the **realistic uplift** is estimated at **\$165K–\$221K**, representing a **~104% uplift for this block**.
- This scenario demonstrates how MMM can replace unreliable MTA for TOF channels and support smarter spend reallocation.

## 📌 Final Conclusion

*"Reallocating inefficient spend can unlock meaningful incremental revenue. Combining MMM outputs with conservative, transparent assumptions ensures recommendations are realistic and defensible for senior stakeholders."*
