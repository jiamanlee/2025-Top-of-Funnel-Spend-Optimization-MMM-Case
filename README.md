# Top-of-Funnel Performance Review — MMM Reallocation Case

A practical case study completed for a **Professional Service Analyst** prompt, using **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** to validate and optimize **top-of-funnel (TOF)** marketing spend for a consumer mattress brand.

---

## 🧭 Business Context

**Brand:** Confidential Consumer Brand  
**Annual Marketing Spend:** ~$5M  
**Primary Stakeholder:** Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

**Business Challenge**  
The leadership team needed an independent validation of TOF performance. Existing **Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)** reporting failed to reliably measure the true incremental impact of awareness and prospecting channels.

**Solution Approach**  
We applied **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** to diagnose channel efficiency, surface underperformers, and simulate realistic upside from budget reallocation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Evaluate all active TOF channels using MMM output  
- Classify channels as **Good**, **Watchlist**, or **Weak** using ROI, uncertainty, spend, and revenue impact  
- Identify inefficient spend (ROI < 2)  
- Quantify realistic incremental revenue from reallocation  
- Deliver defensible, executive-ready recommendations

**Revenue Impact Simulation — Spend Reallocation Scenario**  
Identified **$263K+** in inefficient TOF spend.  
After conservative adjustments, reallocation delivers **$165K–$221K incremental revenue (~104% uplift)**.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **$263K+** identified in underperforming TOF spend (ROI < 2)  
- Theoretical upside if fully reallocated to top channels (ROI ~9): **≈ $2.2M**  
- Conservative realization model (diminishing returns + 15–20% execution factor) yields **$165K–$221K** realistic uplift  
- Demonstrates how **MMM provides a more reliable optimization lens** than traditional MTA for TOF channels
